# WebP Battery test

A battery test experiment. This demo uses the [Battery Statys API](https://w3c.github.io/battery/) and decodes as many JPEG or WebP images as possible within a given (preset) battery drop. Hence, this test focuses on battery performance rather than speed.

Use the edit icon on the top right to modify the settings, and start button to run the experiment.

The UI is built with [PaperGUI](http://google.github.io/paper-gui).
